# Contributing

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. 

I have done this to avoid repetitive working creating java beans from Oracle tables. I only developed what needed in my case, which was simple. 

If current features are not enough for you, here are ways of contributing:

- You can open an issue and discuss what you need
- You can provide a failing test case for me to implement when I can, with a corner case not currently supported
- You can provide both a test case and the code to pass it and submit to review

I don't commit to maintaining this project actively, but I can try to implement new things when I get time. 
If a bunch of people start contributing with corner cases, this project can become something bigger and we all would benefit from it.
